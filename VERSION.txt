** Current version **
v4.2.0 release
**Major update of the normalisation module**
We changed ANTS by antsRegistration for the normalisation and updated the optimisation parameters

** Previous updates **
v4.1.0 release
**Major improvement in Disconnectome Maps module**
**Minor modifications and fixes**
Improvement of the Normalisation
Fix in functionnal connectivity module (temprorary deactivation of the multiprocessing to avoid crashes in some cases)

v4.0.0 release
**Major modifications in AnaCOM2 module**
We replaced the self-made bash bonferroni-holm correction by the bonferroni_holm correction from R (Results which are significant or not won't change but corrected pvalues might be different).
We also added the possibility to compare disconnected patients, spared patients and controls using a Kruskal-Wallis test before applying a post-hoc Mann-Whitney test which can now compare 
diconnected patients with spared patients or controls, or spared patients with controls. 

v3.2.0 beta
**New method for brain extraction**
We replaced the bet2 method by the antsBrainExtraction from ants.

v3.1.0 beta
**New module : Functionnal connectivity on fMRI images (by Leonardo Cerliani) **

v3.0.0 beta
**New module : Resting State Preprocessing (by Leonardo Cerliani) **
**New method for lesion masking**
We added the enantiomorphic (ref : "Enantiomorphic normalization of focally lesioned brains." Nachev.P, 2007) method to mask lesion in all modules that use T1 images by replacing the leionned area by the healthy tissue of the oposite hemisphere (Obviously it won't work if lesions are like symetrical on both hemispheres). 
-Cortical Thickness : If you have lesions associated to your T1s, you can add them in the module. Then we compute the enantiomorphic tranformation of T1s and we calculate the Cortical Thickness on this "healthy" brain to avoid non sense tranformations and after we delete the lesionned area (because cortical thickness values are not relevant in lesionned areas). 
-Normalisation : You can choose the enantiomorphic method to mask lesions instead of simple masking. 
-Resting State : You can add a lesion folder to mask lesions on T1s to have more precise values for the preprocessing of RS.
Disconnectome Maps : We added the possibility to add a minimum threshold that will be applied to all results 
Tractotron : Bug fix that may cause false negatives in the severity calculation

v2.0.20
** Module modifications **
*All modules : -Log files are now available and work better for every modules
*Tractotron : -We added a new calculation to get the proportion of overlaping 
between lesions and tracts, the result is in a separate file
              -Now you can just select the result folder and results files will
be generated inside
*Normalisation : -In the settings frame, you can now manually select the 
The step-size impacts accuracy (SyN parameter of ANTs)
*AnaCOM2 

v2.0.5
** New module **
-AnaCOM2 : compare scores of lesioned patients with controls scores at a neuropsychological test and try to find which lesioned area affect the score
** GUI **
-Log files for all modules before AnaCOM2

v1.1.1:
** Files **
-New template added : BCBToolKit/Tools/extraFiles/MNI152_wskull.nii.gz
** Bug Corrections **
-Normalisation didn't work if bet value wasn"t manually defined
-In Normalisation, temporary files wasn't all saved if you checked the option
